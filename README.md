# Swifty-Ninja
This project consists the solution to the challenges 23 of  hacking with swift.

  Challenges:
  - Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.
  - Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
  - Add a “Game over” sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.
